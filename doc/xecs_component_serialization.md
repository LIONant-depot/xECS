Serializing components is a deceitfully tricky operation, here are some of the reasons why:

* Needs to be easy to use for the end-user
* Has to provide forward and backwards compatibility
* It should allow the Scene Loader to skip deleted components
* It needs to be debugable (a nice text format to inspect), yet remain performant 
* It also needs to be relatively fast. A binary file must also be supported

xECS supports a few ways to save the components:

1. By properties (This is the default way)
2. By serialize function. This provides a much faster way to serialize your components and can be used for simple components.
3. By a full serialize function. Also a very fast way to serialize components but this version allows to deal with complex components as well.


## Scene entity-id remapping 

When serializing entities in Scenes we need to remap any reference that they may have. **SO IS VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO FORGET TO ADD THE CALLBACK TO THE RIGHT COMPONENTS**. The right components are any component that have references to other entities. Such like the Hierarchy component.

Here is an example on how to do this:
~~~cpp

namespace details
{
    void ReportEntites( std::vector<xecs::component::entity*>& , std::byte* ) noexcept;
}

struct hierarchy
{
    // Sets our function as the m_pReportReferencesFn method, this will let the system knows to call us when remapping is necessary
    static constexpr auto typedef_v = xecs::component::type::data
    {
        .m_pReportReferencesFn  = details::ReportEntites
    };

    xecs::component::entity              m_Parent;          // Who is our parent entity?
    std::vector<xecs::component::entity> m_Children;        // A vector with all our children entities 
};

void details::ReportEntites( std::vector<xecs::component::entity*>& Entities, std::byte* pComponent ) noexcept
{
    auto& Hierarchy = *reinterpret_cast<hierarchy*>(pComponent);
    Entities.push_back( &Hierarchy.m_Parent );
    for( auto& E : Hierarchy.m_Children ) Entities.push_back( &E );
}
~~~

Ideally this should be done with the properties. So this is something that we could look into fixing in the future.

## Serializing via Properties (Default)

Properties are a very important concept in game development, and it is used for different type of functionality:

1. Create prefabs
2. Edit the component
3. Multi-Select Edits of components
4. Copy and paste components
5. Scripting functionality
6. Serializing 

Here is simple example on how to use it:
~~~cpp
struct transform
{
    static constexpr auto typedef_v = xecs::component::type::data{};

    xcore::quaternion   m_Rotation;
    xcore::vector3      m_Position;
    xcore::vector3      m_Scale;
};

// Here are the properties for our transform component
property_begin( transform )
{
      property_var( m_Position )
    , property_var( m_Rotation  )
    , property_var( m_Scale  )
} property_end_h()
~~~

It can get allot more complex depending on what you are doing, but simple components don't require allot.

## Serialize function (Advance Topic)

Like mention serialize function is not very complex to do and does provide extra speed for the components. Please note that the serialization function only gets used to serialize the component and nothing else. Having properties still a requirement for many of the other features.

Here is an example on how to serialize the above component.

<details><summary><i><b>Example </b>(Click to open)</i></summary>

~~~cpp
namespace details
{
    // Pre-defines the serialization function, this function needs to have this exact signature
    xcore::err Serialize( xcore::textfile::stream&, bool, std::byte* ) noexcept;
}

struct transform
{
    // Sets our function as the serialization method. By putting it here the system will know to use it and skip the properties.
    static constexpr auto typedef_v = xecs::component::type::data
    {
        .m_pSerilizeFn  = details::Serialize
    };

    xcore::quaternion   m_Rotation;
    xcore::vector3      m_Position;
    xcore::vector3      m_Scale;
};

// Serialize function
xcore::err details::Serialize           // Note that the function returns an error code
( xcore::textfile::stream&  TextFile    // xcore provides the serializer, so this is the instance to it
, bool                   // isRead      // Variable that tells you if we are reading or writing (This example does not use it)
, std::byte*                pComponent  // Generic Pointer to the component
) noexcept                              // Note that the function is marked as no throwing exceptions 
{
    auto&       Transform = *reinterpret_cast<transform*>(pComponent); // Converts the byte pointer to our component
    xcore::err  Error;                                                 // Variable to store the error if any

    // Each of the function will read/write the component data and if there is an error it will store it in the Error 
    // variable and immediately stop reading or writing
       (Error = TextFile.Field( "Position", Transform.m_Position.m_X, Transform.m_Position.m_Y. Transform.m_Position.m_Z ))
    || (Error = TextFile.Field( "Rotation", Transform.m_Rotation.m_X, Transform.m_Rotation.m_Y. Transform.m_Rotation.m_Z, Transform.m_Rotation.m_W ))
    || (Error = TextFile.Field( "Scale",    Transform.m_Scale.m_X,    Transform.m_Scale.m_Y.    Transform.m_Scale.m_Z ))

    // Returns the error if any
    return Error;
}

## Full Serialize function (Very Advance Topic)

When you want to serialize complex components quickly then you will need this method. This allow you to save components that have vectors and other types of complex containers. That been said this is a more complex topic and requires semi-advance users:

<details><summary><i><b>Example </b>(Click to open)</i></summary>

~~~cpp
namespace details
{
    // Pre-defines the serialization function, this function need sto have this exact signature
    xcore::err FullSerialize( xcore::textfile::stream&, bool, std::byte*, int& ) noexcept;
}

struct hierarchy
{
    // Sets our function as the serialization method. By putting it here the system will know to use it and skip the properties.
    static constexpr auto typedef_v = xecs::component::type::data
    {
        .m_pFullSerializeFn  = details::FullSerialize
    };

    xecs::component::entity              m_Parent;          // Who is our parent entity?
    std::vector<xecs::component::entity> m_Children;        // A vector with all our children entities 
};

// Serialize function
xcore::err details::FullSerialize       // Note that the function returns an error code
( xcore::textfile::stream&  TextFile    // [IN] xcore provides the serializer, so this is the instance to it
, bool                      isRead      // [IN] Variable that tells you if we are reading or writing (This example does not use it)
, std::byte*                pComponentArray // [IN/OUT] Pointer to the begging of the array of our components
, int&                      Count       // [IN/OUT] When writing it tells us how many entities we must write, when reading we must return how many we read
) noexcept                              // Note that the function is marked as no throwing exceptions 
{
    auto&       pHierarchyArray = *reinterpret_cast<hierarchy*>(pComponentArray); // Converts the byte pointer to our array of components
    xcore::err  Error;                                                            // Variable to store the error if any

    //
    // This first block of data we will serialize all the component information:
    // which for the moment is the parent and the number of children.
    // All the children will be serialize together as a separate table
    //
    int TotalChildren=0;    // We want to know the total number of children form all the components together
    if( TextFile.Record     // This record function will return true if it found an error
    ( Error                 // We pass the error variable to get the actual error this variable gets used in the callbacks too
    , "Hierarchy"           // Name of this record
    , [&]                   // This is our callback to deal with how many entries in our table
    ( std::size_t& Size     // [IN/OUT] [In] how many element we are reading, [Out] How many we are writing
    , xcore::err&           // [OUT] There won't be any errors to report
    ) noexcept    
    {
        // If we are reading then we will need to report to the caller of FullSerialize how many entries we got
        if( isRead ) Count = static_cast<int>(Size);
        else         Size  = Count;      // If we are writing then we need to tell the text file how many entries we will write
    }

    {

        int   nChildren = isRead ? 0 : static_cast<int>(Hierarchy.m_Children.count());

        // We serialize the Parent and The number of children

    ) noexcept
    {
